I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Now Secure](http://www.nowsecure.com). Previously, I have worked at Motorola Mobility, IBM Research and Amazon. 

I have a PhD in Computer Engineering from University of Florida. The topic of my dissertation was *Identifying Social Markers from Network data based on Location, Mobility, and Proximity.*

This blog is based on Jekyll theme [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and uses several titbits from [Anand Manishankar's blog](http://anandmanisankar.com). Thanks guys!
